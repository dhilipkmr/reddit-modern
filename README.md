# Modern Reddit
 A new Design for Reddit

BUilt Reddit UI and published in heroku as [Reddit-material](https://reddit-material.herokuapp.com/) with just one api(Subreddit) being exposed this is pretty much what I could do.
Made it Responsive, Cached resources, Lazy loaded images and on reaching end of the page made next Api call to load susequent posts
